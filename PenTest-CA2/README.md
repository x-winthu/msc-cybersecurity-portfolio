# 🛡️ Network Security and Penetration Testing (CA2 Project)

This project is part of the MSc in Cybersecurity coursework at the National College of Ireland. It presents a security analysis and penetration testing assessment of a simulated educational campus network, inspired by CoderDojo-style learning environments.

## 📚 Project Overview
- Simulated environment with 50–100 users
- Network includes BYOD, IoT, internal services, cloud apps, and public Wi-Fi
- Risk-based threat modeling and assessment
- Analysis performed on realistic CVEs (2023–2025)

## 🔍 Key Vulnerabilities Assessed
- **Wi-Fi Exploitation:** Cisco MR56 WPA3 bypass – *CVE-2024-53150*
- **Web Server RCE:** Apache Tomcat – *CVE-2025-30154*
- **Phishing Risk:** Misconfigured O365/Browser – *CVE-2023-28311*

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Nmap
- Wireshark
- Metasploit
- Burp Suite
- Microsoft Defender / CrowdStrike
- Kali Linux

## 🛡️ Mitigation Strategies
- Segmenting networks with VLANs
- Using IPS/IDS systems
- Enforcing security policies
- End-user training and email protection
- Patching and secure configuration
